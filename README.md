# videos

Parables about computing, in short video form.

- data about urls and clip location is stored in toml files
- full videos are downloaded using yt-dlp
- clips are created using ffmpeg

Make is used to "compile" video urls into full videos, and then "compile" full videos into clips.

See Makefile for details.

# Todo

- Fix Makefile, the dependencies are wrong
